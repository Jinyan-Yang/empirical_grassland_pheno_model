# Empirical_grassland_pheno_model

## Goal
Fit the Choler-Hufkens model to observed cover data to obtain parameter values. These parameters include: growth and senescence rates as well as the power of the beta functions which describe the sensitivity of those rates to soil moisture availability. 
 
## Structure
r/ has he code to do fitting.  

data/ contains data sets that are not currently on cloud storage, while download/ has all data that can be downloaded from HIEv. 

makeFigure/ has the code to do plotting, the outcome of which are in figures/. 

cache/ has the ftting results as well as processed data sets. tmp/ then has predictions based on fitting for easy access.
